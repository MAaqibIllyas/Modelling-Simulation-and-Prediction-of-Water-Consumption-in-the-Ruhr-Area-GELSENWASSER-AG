# Modelling-Simulation-and-Prediction-of-Water-Consumption-in-the-Ruhr-Area-(GELSENWASSER AG)
<<<<<<< HEAD


### Task

A series of experiments is conducted for the prediction of water consumption in the Ruhr area in cooperation with GELSENWASSER AG. The modern online machine-learning algorithms and classical batch-learning approaches are cosidered for this project. The Univariate and Multivariate (including Environmental conditions) time-series datasets are obtained from one of the largest German water provider and the plausible predictions are made regarding water consumption using different algorithms. The question is whether online machine learning algorithms are a valuable alternative to traditional batch learning approaches. The comparison of various models is done in terms of Time, Memory & Performance using the standard Evaluation functions. The Hyperparameter Tuning is also carried out with tghe help of 'spotRiver' package to get best results.

This project covers the following steps:

## Univariate Time-series Data Analysis


* ### Partial Auto-Correlation (PACF)

* ### Decomposition of Time Series Data

## Batch Learning Algorithms

* ### MSTL Model (Multi-Seasonal Time Series Decomposition)

* ### AutoETS Model (Automatic Exponential Smoothing)

* ### AutoArima "Automatic AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average"

* ### Naive Forecaster

## Online Machine Learning Algorithms
